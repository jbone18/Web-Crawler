                        Tapped In is a web app that provides a single point of contact to all tap house's and breweries in the greater Spokane area. This platform will provide users, who are 21 and over, the ability to enjoy the full experience of breweries in Spokane in a fashion never seen before. This seamless web app will be accessible on any device that has internet capabilities, making it available to anyone who has a smart phone, laptop, tablet or other device. This will allow both apple and android users to access the same quality content and decrease the amount of resources required to keep the platform up to date.

This exciting experience is accomplished by providing the following content.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A database of drinks that auto updates past, present and future with the option to create multiple user profiles. These user profiles will allow the use of a personalized drink rating system with push notifications of brewery events and new taps tailored to the user's interests. There will also be access to a map of brewery locations.
                    </p>
                </div>
                     
                <div id=intro class=center>
                    <p>
                        Features such as a personalized profile of drinks will encourage veteran users to continue using the web app because they will have an easily accessible list of their favorite and least favorite drinks. New users will be able to discovery new brewery's they haven't heard of and can use others reviews of drinks to determine what they want. Everyone who uses this web page will find a multitude of features that is applicable to there current situation. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A key and unique feature of this web app is its ability to auto-update both the drink list and brewery events. This auto-update ability will allow the user to encounter new content from one location rather than having to wait or double check a brewery's website to confirm events and drinks. This web app will also include the persona and culture of Spokane into its thematic layout. A customized and community theme/feature is what will truly set this web app apart from pre-existing sites which mainly give a sense of mass-social media appeal. In recent years, the desire for personalized, smaller community driven features has been driving the app market and is what Tapped In plans to take advantage of.

                <p><strong>Critical Feedback:</strong></p>
                <p style= "text-align:left">
                    <ol>    
                        <li><ins>Elizabeth Bone</ins>: There are larger websites that provide this option, but there is nothing specific to the local Spokane area. Not sure if I trust random user reviews, would there be an option for expert reviews? Pushing notifications and auto-update of new beers on tap would be the biggest motivator for daily use. May not use this product because I don't drink a ton of beer. Potentially include notifications based on personalized preferences. I like IPA so I only want notifications related to new IPA's.</li>
                        <br>

                        <li><ins>Craig Bone</ins>: This website would only be as updated as the individual brewery websites. This could cause a problem with lazy business websites that don't publish new events/drinks. Rating beers and keeping track of them is a huge motivator for using the app. Being able to search for a specific drink and find breweries that are serving that drink would be amazing. Event notification is also a cool feature. Maybe this could be expanded to coffee, wine, craft goods?</li>
                        <br>

                        <li><ins>Nikki Dehle</ins>: There needs to some way that as you interact with the app that you make progression. ie. Level up, earn loyalty points, etc...</li>
                        <br>

                        <li><ins>Mykah French</ins>: It needs to have a very Spokane/PNW feel. Highlight the culture as much as possible. If the app were to expand have a very curated feel based on the nearest major city.</li>
                        <br>
                        
                        <li><ins>Judy Dehle</ins>: The app needs to be clean, large text, big bold hi-res pictures. Navigation needs to be along the top. Make it as intuitive as possible.</li>
